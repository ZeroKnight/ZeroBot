"""
ZeroBot is a modular, mutli-protocol (originally and primarily IRC) bot. This
bot exists primarily for amusement and arbitrary utility, but otherwise serves
no major or specific purpose. I created him to bum around in channels and
servers that I frequent, so he was originally and always will be a pet project.
